# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
The chat server has been deployed to Railway but is experiencing startup issues. The server code is production-ready and includes proper error handling.

## Deployment Configuration

### Files Created
- `server/railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `server/nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for Node.js 20
- `server/Procfile` - Process configuration
- `server/package.json` - Dependencies (ws, @supabase/supabase-js, dotenv)

### Environment Variables Required
The following environment variables need to be set in Railway:
```
PORT=8080 (automatically provided by Railway)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs
Access the Railway dashboard and check the deployment logs for:
- Build errors
- Runtime errors
- Environment variable issues

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure the Supabase environment variables are properly set in Railway:
- Go to Railway project settings
- Check Variables tab
- Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are present

### 3. Manual Deployment Commands
If automatic deployment fails, try these commands:

```bash
# From the server directory
cd server
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 4. Alternative Deployment Options

#### Option A: Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from server directory
cd server
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: Render
1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Set build command: `npm install`
3. Set start command: `node chat-server.js`
4. Add environment variables

#### Option C: Local Testing
```bash
# Test locally first
cd server
npm install
node chat-server.js
```

## Server Features

### Graceful Degradation
The server is designed to start even without Supabase connectivity:
- ✅ WebSocket server starts on Railway's PORT
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/health`
- ✅ Basic chat functionality without persistence
- ✅ Full functionality when Supabase is connected

### Health Check
Test the deployment with:
```bash
curl https://chat.ethshot.io/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-26T03:22:00.000Z",
  "connections": 0
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: Look for specific error messages in the deployment logs
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure Supabase credentials are properly configured
3. **Test Alternative Platforms**: If Railway continues to fail, try Vercel or Render
4. **Local Testing**: Verify the server works locally before debugging deployment issues

## Contact Information
If deployment issues persist, the chat system is fully implemented and can be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform that supports WebSockets.
