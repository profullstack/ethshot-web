ðŸŽ¯ Wallet Warning Expected!

Your wallet may show "insufficient funds" warning because:
â€¢ It only sees the gas cost going out
â€¢ It cannot predict that you might WIN ETH back
â€¢ The contract will automatically send winnings if you win

âœ… This warning is SAFE to ignore for reveals
âœ… The transaction will succeed
âœ… You'll receive winnings if you win (much more than gas cost)

This is normal behavior - proceed with confidence! ðŸš€
